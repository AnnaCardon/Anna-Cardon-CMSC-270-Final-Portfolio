Large image datasets: A pyrrhic win for computer vision?
MIT takes down 80 Million Tiny Images data set due to racist and offensive content | VentureBeat

We read these articles that got the class thinking about the broader consequences of designing 
and developing large, data-driven systems. The articles were titled "Large image datasets: A pyrrhic win for computer vision?" and 
"MIT takes down 80 Million Tiny Images data set due to racist and offensive content". We talked of how these articles shed light on 
the societal, ethical, and practical considerations that arise when working with vast amounts of data. These articles made me realize 
the importance of being mindful of the unintended consequences that can arise from relying solely on massive datasets without proper 
regulations. From the class discussion the comment that stuck with me the most was, "As engineers we have to think about what our 
inventions do to society. In computer science we never talk about how our code will effect the world." I believe this was said by Fadila.
This brings forth the idea that there needs to be change in the technology world surrounding ethics. That there is still much work 
to be done in areas such as dataset quality, algorithmic biases, and addressing the social impact of these systems. Technology is a 
area of study that calls for further exploration, attention, and possible regulation.
