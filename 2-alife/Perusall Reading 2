As a class we read the paper "On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big?" 
This paper made me reflect on the current problems with Artificial Intelligence (AI). Some of the problems in AI include 
ensuring fairness, addressing biases in algorithms, making sure its understandable, and how these databases don't include 
all perspectives. We talked about how television companies are having AI write screenplays and underpaying humans to edit it.
We talked about the fear of AI taking over jobs and how it can negatively impact students in learning. Reading this paper brought 
to my attention the need to considerate ethics and possible harmful outcomes of AI. It reminded me that as AI technology advances 
rapidly, it is important to address these open problems to ensure responsible and good use of AI systems.
