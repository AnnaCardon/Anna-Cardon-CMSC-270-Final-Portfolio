During my check-ins with the professor, I discovered that I was failing the class. However, with 
the help and guidance of Acacia, I was able to turn things around and improve my grade. I took a proactive approach 
by diligently completing all my homework assignments, attending every class session, doing the required readings, and 
actively participating in class discussions. Whenever the professor provided feedback on my code or my engagement in 
class, I took it to heart and made the necessary adjustments. If I happened to miss a check-in, I made sure to schedule 
a new one promptly. I truly gave it my all and did my best to stay on top of the class to the best of my abilities at that time.
