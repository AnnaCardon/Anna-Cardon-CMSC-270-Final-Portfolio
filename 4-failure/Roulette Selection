I had initially tried to code the roullete selction for the hackathon. I took notes on the reading and inclass. Tried to write
it as sudo code first and then implement it. I asked questions and edited and modified. In the end I did not finishing the code
and instead did the tournanment selection. This was not a complete failure since I really did try to do the roullete selection
and took multiple steps. In the end it was too hard. I got stuck on passing the right objects to the right places, I couldn't 
wrap my head around it.
